### Overview 

You can use this tool to explore the relationship between binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$), expression (log10 $$MFI$$), and polyspecificity for all anti-CGG naive antibody variants. You can select the antibody regions and residue transitions of particular interest.

#### Instructions

To use this tool, select the antibody region and/or mutant and wildtype residues to highlight in the plots by clicking on the selection bars. Multiple selections can be made by holding `shift` when clicking. You can deselect highlighted areas by `double-clicking`.
