### Overview

You can use this tool to explore the experimentally determined impacts of amino acid mutations on binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$), expression (log10 $$MFI$$), and polyspecificity for all anti-CGG naive antibody variants. 

#### Instruction

To use this tool, you can select a region of interest using a zoom bar. Hover over individual mutations to see exact numerical details.

#### Technical Details

The impact on binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$), expression (log10 $$MFI$$), and polyspecificity for all anti-CGG naive antibody variants, was determined by high-throughput titration assays. Wildtype amino acids are indicated by an **x**, and gray squares indicate missing mutations from each library. The number of internally replicated barcodes with which a mutation was measured is visible as `Barcode Count` in the tooltips, where higher numbers indicate higher-confidence measurements.

More information can be found in our preprint [here](). Raw data can be found [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/Ab-CGGnaive_DMS#deep-mutational-scanning-of-the-cggnaive-scfv).
