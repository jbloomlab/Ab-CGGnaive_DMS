## Overview 

This is an analysis of deep mutational scanning of barcoded codon variants of anti-CGG naive antibody. 

### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the change in binding affinity ($$\Delta$$log10 $$K_D$$), expression (log10 $$MFI$$), and polyspecifity caused by mutations in each CGGnaive antibody variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps.md %}).

2. An interactive widget that you can use to visualize the relationship between binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$), expression (log10 $$MFI$$), and polyspecificity between variant CGGnaive antibodies. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link comparison.md %}).  

### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find it [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/Ab-CGGnaive_DMS#deep-mutational-scanning-of-the-cggnaive-scfv).
